# MuLang
Currenlty built for the intention of learning Japanese. After the entire framework is more established, I will start expanding it to support other languages.

Learn your language with music. Just like Spotify and other music services, read the auto-scrolling lyrics as you listen. When you encounter new vocabulary or grammar or just want to understand what the sentence means, click on the smaller and lighter text below the lyric to access the definitions and breakdown of the sentence into its components and grammar. Login to save your progress.

This is a preview of the current state. No AI involved for now.
